## GGR472 Lab 2

#### Purpose 
Lab 2 aimed to build off of Lab 1's work and develop our knowledge and skills for future application in our group projects. The goal was to create a new webmap including a Mapbox style I created as a basemap as well as two data layers added to the map and visualised via JavaScript. 

#### The Map
Building off of work generated in Lab 1, this project embedded a web map using Mapbox GL JS into an existing html page from Lab 1. The map illustrates Toronto's bike lane system as well as outdoor parking locations for bikes across the city. This is accompanied by a brief description to clarify symbology of the map as well as an external link to learn more about Toronto's bike lanes. 

This repository contains code for the webpage which includes a web map (with a map style I created) and GeoJSON data layers. 

#### The Website 
Ultimately, while fairly simple, this website contains code to showcase transit near UofT's campus. This includes major roads near campus, bike lanes and parking locations, and major TTC stations near campus. 

The final webpage can be found here: INSERT THE WEBPAGE HERE
