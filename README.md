## GGR472 Lab 2

Building off the work accomplished in Lab 1, I created my first web map with Mapbox GL JS and embedded it into one of the existing html pages I had from Lab 1. 

This repository contains code lifted from Lab 1, as well as the code for the webpage which includes a web map (with a map style I created) and GeoJSON data layers. 

The final webpage can be found here: INSER THE WEBPAGE HERE
